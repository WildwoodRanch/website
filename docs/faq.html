Be sure to pack an extra change of clothes and shoes for the week. Depending on the weather outlook for your child's week, don't forget:<ul><li>Extra shoes - rain boots or sandals</li><li>Extra pants, shorts or a bathing suit</li></ul></p><p>All children have the opportunity to work with and ride horses. For their safety they must bring:<ul><li>a well fitting helmet (bicycle is okay)</li><li>sturdy shoes capable of protecting their feet when working with animals</li></ul></p><p>We provide snacks and juice daily, as well as a cookout lunch with lots of choices on Friday.<ul><li>Pack a sack lunch Monday-Thursday.</li><li>Daily drop off is 9:00am with pick up at 3:00pm. Check in on Mondays begins at 8:45.</li></ul></p></div><div class="question"><h3>What if my child has food allergies or other medical needs?</h3><p>We can accommodate a wide variety of food allergies and medical needs. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with any
known allergies or medical needs and we can create a plan for your child's week at camp.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What time should I pick up and drop off my child?</h3><p>Camp starts at 9am and ends at 3pm. Please let <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> know if you need further flexibility.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Will my children be able to be in the same group?</h3><p>Yes. When children are put into groups, they are asked to sit next to friends or family they wish to be
grouped with. Feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with special requests.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What is the average group size?</h3><p>Children are broken into groups of 8-12, depending on needs and requests. This is your child's home
base and how they are organized for specific activities. Each group has 2 counselors which remain
for the week.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Does my child have to pack a lunch?</h3><p>Monday - Thursday children must bring sack lunches. Friday we have a cook-out,
so no sack lunch is needed. Snacks will be provided.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Does my child have to eat breakfast before coming to camp?</h3><p>Tuesday and Wednesday children have the opportunity to make breakfast sandwiches with egg, cinnamon-sugar,
or fruit filling. Monday, Thursday, and Friday children must eat before camp. Snacks will be provided.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What happens if it's raining?</h3><p>Camp still runs in the rain. We have several buildings that are under cover including the barn,
craft-shack, and several spaces covered by awnings. We revise some activities to bring them under cover.
Bring some rain boots and a rain jacket, and possibly an extra change of clothes!</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How often will my child ride a horse and what if they do not want to?</h3><p>Children have the opportunity to ride each day of camp. We have experience with reluctant
riders and will do our best to encourage them. We will not force any child to ride.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>My child knows how to ride a horse. Can they do something more advanced?</h3><p>We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How do I get ahold of someone while my child is at camp?</h3><p>Please call Kate on her cell (<a href="tel:4258026705">4258026705</a>) or MacKenzie on her cell (<a href="tel:4252605024">4252605024</a>) during camp hours. Please leave a message if necessary.
The phone is nearby but our hands may be busy!</p></div></div></section></main><footer><section id="footerLeft"><h3>Upcoming</h3><ul><li>April 8-12, 2019 - Spring Camp</li></ul></section><section id="footerMid"></section><section id="footerRight"><h3>Contact</h3><address><p>34920 SE Fall City Snoqualmie Rd <br/> Fall City, WA 98024</p><a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">info@wildwoodranch.co</a></address><section class="social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-instagram"></i></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wildwoodranch.co"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-facebook-square"></i></a><a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-envelope-square"></i></a><a href="tel:4258026705"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-phone-square"></i></a></section></section></footer></body></html>
