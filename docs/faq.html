Please see our <a href="covid.html">COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span></a> page for details.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What happens if my child or someone in their group gets sick<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>All campers and staff will participate in daily health screenings and temperature checks. 
Any person exhibiting symptoms of COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> will be asked to return
home and only allowed back once a negative COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> test is obtained 
or an alternate diagnosis given by a physician. If a camper or staff tests positive for COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>
and they have potentially had contact with your camper, you will be notified and asked to quarantine according 
to King County standards. If this interrupts your childs camp you will be refunded for the remaining days. Please 
see our <a href="covid.html">COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span></a> page for more details.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How do I register for camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>See our upcoming sessions and register or log into your existing account from our <a href="register.html">register</a> page.
We have a new registration system this year through Ultra Camp, please let <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a>
know if you need any assistance. 
</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What if I need to cancel or change my registration<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Our standard cancellation policy offers a full refund for any reason for up to a week before your registered session. After that date, we offer credit toward a future week of camp. Please email <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> if you need to cancel your registration or switch dates.
Please see our <a href="covid.html">COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span></a> page for our revised policy during the COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> pandemic.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What should my child bring to camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Our farm is an active, outdoor-oriented camp so dressing appropriately is important. Be sure to pack an extra change of clothes and shoes for the week. Depending on the weather outlook for your child's week, don't forget:<ul><li>Extra shoes - rain boots or sandals</li><li>Extra pants, shorts or a bathing suit</li></ul></p><p>All children have the opportunity to work with and ride horses. For their safety they must bring:<ul><li>a well fitting helmet (bicycle is okay)</li><li>sturdy shoes capable of protecting their feet when working with animals, must be closed-toe</li></ul></p><p>We provide snacks and water daily, as well as a cookout lunch with lots of choices on Friday.<ul><li>Pack a sack lunch Monday-Thursday.</li><li>Daily drop off is 9:00am with pick up at 3:00pm. Check in on Mondays begins at 8:45.</li></ul></p></div><div class="question"><h3>What does a typical day of camp look like<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Each day has 6 stations usually consisting of horseback riding, arts and crafts, cooking and
homestead snacks, group games, gardening, and animal time. The activities that occur in each
category change every day. For example, arts and crafts may make tie dye t-shirts, leather 
bracelets, puppets, picture frames, and friendship bracelets throughout the week. Garden time
may have a tasting tour, learning how plants grow, helping to tend the garden and plant new 
things, making chia pets, and planting their own sunflower. We have many activities and switch
them up throughout the summer so that the flow is familiar but no two days or weeks are ever identical. </p></div><div class="question"><h3>Can I sign my camper up for multiple sessions in one year<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Short answer is yes. We change up our activities from day to day and week to week so that things are never
exactly the same. But that being said, some campers expect a totally new experience and are not happy 
returning. You know your camper best and should know whether or not coming multiple weeks is a good idea for them.
The specialty camps are not intended to be taken more than once each, the July and August offerings are repeats, not
continuations. </p></div><div class="question"><h3>How is the Specialty Day Camp program different than your Classic Ranch Camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>The Specialty Camps are new offerings in 2022, so while we have a lot of ideas we are not set on all of 
the details as of yet. Specialty camps are for campers ages 10-15 who are looking for a new experience at camp.
Half of each day will focus on their specialty projects while the other half will be spent experiencing the 
classic ranch activities such as horseback riding, gardening, crafts, homestead snacks, games, and small animal time. 
Campers will not do all 6 “classic” activities each day but will be able to experience all of them at 
least once during their week at camp. Limited to 10 campers per session. </p></div><div class="question"><h3>How is the Counselor in Training program different than your Classic Ranch Camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>The CIT program is for campers ages 12-15 who have attended Wildwood Ranch in
the past (not a strict requirement for 2022, but will be in the future) but are aging out of the program 
or are ready for a new 
adventure at camp. Each day will have dedicated time to learn, discuss, and practice leadership skills
as a team before exploring interests at camp and on the farm. CITs will have the opportunity to customize their week 
to their interests by helping in different areas. Possible placements at camp include working with the 
horses (learning ground skills, care and keeping, and body and tack parts), as a junior counselor to a
camper group, assisting in leading activities (arts and crafts, campfire cooking or games), helping
with the small animals, or working in our garden. Our goal is for each CIT to learn practical 
leadership skills, have a positive experience practicing and implementing those skills at camp, to have 
a deeper understanding of what it means to be a responsible citizen, and have fun!</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What if my child has food allergies or other medical needs<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>We can accommodate a wide variety of food allergies and medical needs. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with any
known allergies or medical needs and we can create a plan for your child's week at camp.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What time should I pick up and drop off my child<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Camp starts at 9am and ends at 3pm. Please let <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> know if 
you need further flexibility and we will try to work with you.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How do I reach the Ranch from the road and where should I park<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Make sure to turn your blinker on and slow down a ways in advance of the turn off from Fall
City Snoqualmie Rd. The speed limit is 50 and there are many semis that drive down the road.
The driveway is between the white vinyl fenced fields and the row of mailboxes, just West of
the “All Pets go to Heaven” sign. Our driveway is shared with neighbors and is not quite
two lanes wide, please go slow and pass others safely and with care. Drive up along the
white fencing and turn right into the loop driveway with the enter sign. There are parking
spots at the top of the loop and continuing down the other side. If your family is new to 
Wildwood Ranch or your camper has new medical needs this year, please park and walk your
campers across the driveway and into the fields on Monday morning, there will be a check in 
table inside the gate. Pick up and drop off for the remainder of the week will occur in our 
loop driveway. Please stay in your car and pull forward to the pillars, we will bring all campers
up to the loop driveway at 3pm and check them out to you. Please update your authorized pickup lists
as we will not release campers to individuals not on it. 
</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Will my children be able to be in the same group<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>For classic ranch camps, yes. When children are put into groups, they are asked to sit next to friends or family they wish to be
grouped with. Feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with special requests.
</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What is the staff to camper ratio<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Our average staff to camper ratio is 1:5.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How do camper groups work<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Children are broken into groups of 8-12, depending on needs and requests. This is your child's home
base and how they are organized for activities. Each group has counselors which remain with the group
for the week. There is a question during registration asking about friends 
that may be attending the same week whom your camper wishes to be grouped with, if this changes feel free to email
<a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with additional requests or concerns.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Does my child have to pack a lunch<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Monday - Thursday children must bring sack lunches. Friday we have a cook-out,
so no sack lunch is needed. Snacks will be provided daily.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Does my child have to eat breakfast before coming to camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Yes, children must eat before camp. Snacks will be provided later in the day.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>What happens if it is raining<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Camp still runs in the rain. We have several buildings that are under cover including the barn,
potting shed, and several spaces covered by awnings. We revise some activities to bring them under cover.
Bring some rain boots and a rain jacket, and possibly an extra change of clothes!</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How often will my child ride a horse and what if they do not want to<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Children have the opportunity to ride each day of camp. We have experience with reluctant
riders and will do our best to encourage them. We will not force any child to ride.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>My child knows how to ride a horse. Can they do something more advanced<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>Are there discounts available<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Yes<span class="punctuation">!</span> We have a sibling discount as well as a multiple week discount that apply
automatically in your cart at checkout. If you experience any difficulites please email <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a>.</p></div><div class="question"><h3>How do I get ahold of someone while my child is at camp<span class="punctuation">?</span></h3><p>Please call MacKenzie on her cell (<a href="tel:4252605024">(425)260-5024</a>) during camp hours. Please leave a message if necessary.
The phone is nearby but our hands may be busy!</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="row justify-content-center"><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerLeft"><ul><li><a href="http://www.ultracamp.com/info/upcomingsessions.aspx?idCamp=1075&amp;campCode=WWR" target="_blank">Upcoming Sessions</a></li><li><a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Terms & Conditions</a></li></ul></section><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerMid"></section><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerRight"><h3>Contact</h3><address><p>34920 SE Fall City Snoqualmie Rd <br/> Fall City, WA 98024</p><a id="emailLinkFooter" href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">info@wildwoodranch.co</a></address><section class="social"><a id="instaLinkFooter" href="https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-instagram"></i></a><a id="fbLinkFooter" href="https://www.facebook.com/wildwoodranch.co"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-facebook-square"></i></a><a id="emailLinkFooter2" href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-envelope-square"></i></a><a id="phoneLinkFooter" href="tel:4252605024"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-phone-square"></i><!--bump--></a></section></section></footer></body></html>
