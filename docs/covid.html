we are committed to running camps in 2021 to provide social interactions for campers in a safe environment. 
As we approach the Spring and Summer camp season, we endeavor to be transparent with camp families about our approach to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and what steps we are taking to protect our campers, staff, and the community at large.</p><h2> OUR APPROACH</h2><p>COVID-19 is a very real and potentially harmful virus that spreads easily from person to person and is particularly harmful
to people who are vulnerable due to their age or underlying medical conditions. It is the responsibility of the community at
large to minimize the spread of the virus to protect the most vulnerable and to reduce stress on our health care systems. We 
are making our decisions about how to operate camp with that in mind. </p><p>We understand that most children have been home since the end of March 2020 and many families have had limited childcare during
this time. Kids need social interaction and time outdoors, and while we are eager to meet this need, we need to do so with ample
safety measures in place.</p><p>We are fortunate to be an outdoors facility with open-air shelters that allow us to easily comply with all recommended protocols
for group gatherings. At this time, we require all staff, campers, and family members to wear face masks when on Wildwood Ranch 
property. We will do our best to enforce the 6ft social distance rule, but we know that with children this can be especially hard.</p><p>This spring and summer we are limiting enrollment to 45 kids per week. We are further splitting each week into groups of 12 or less
campers, moving each group through activities as independently as possible. We will be eliminating “all camp” times such as campfire
time and large group games and moving them into our rotation of activities for groups to experience on their own to aid in social 
distancing and limiting exposure between groups.</p><p>We expect families to monitor their campers for symptoms of and exposure to COVID-19 for 14 days prior to camp and throughout their
time at Wildwood Ranch. If your child gets sick, has a fever of 100.4 or higher, or exhibits any other symptoms consistent with 
COVID-19, please notify us immediately. Campers will not be able to return to camp for at least 10 days after symptoms start AND 
three days after symptoms, including fever, have improved, or there is an alternate diagnosis from a physician. </p><p>If your child has had close contact with someone who has COVID-19 or has been advised to quarantine, please do not send your child
to camp until they have completed the quarantine required by King County.</p><p>We will be performing health screenings and fever checks upon arrival, any child with a temperature above 100.4°F will be asked to 
return home and will be refunded their camp tuition for any days missed. Any siblings of a camper who has a fever  or other symtoms
will also need to return home.</p><p>As for sanitation policies, we are following the American Camp Association’s guide as closely as possible. We have two hand washing
stations and will require everyone to wash hands upon arrival, between activities, and before/after lunch and snacks (in addition to
the usual washing after bathroom use and touching animals). Gates and doors will be sanitized every morning and evening and will be 
left open where possible so that campers are not touching them unless necessary. All washable surfaces and supplies will be sanitized
daily or after each group uses them. </p><p>Even with these protocols and safety measures in place, it is possible that we will see cases of COVID-19 at camp this year. We cannot
guarantee that your camper will not encounter someone who is contagious, but with our non-pharmacological interventions in place we 
are confident that we can stop a major spreading event from occurring at Wildwood Ranch. If someone at camp becomes ill with COVID-19,
we will notify all families that it may impact. We will then follow King County’s protocol for cleaning, sanitizing, and possible 
temporary closure of camp.</p><p>Thank you for trusting us with your campers during this time. We are committed to providing a safe facility and engaging program so 
that they can explore the natural world around them, make new friends, and improve their self-confidence. 

</p><h2>Refund Policy</h2><p>We have revised our refund policy for the year to allow for refunds to be given at any time for COVID related circumstances. 
If your camper or anyone in your family tests positive for COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>,  believes they have 
COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> symptoms, or has been in close proximity of any confirmed cases without proper PPE, 
they must not attend camp and will receive a FULL refund for days missed. We understand that finances at this time can be 
uncertain or strained. If your family has been financially affected by COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>, please let 
us know and we can work out a plan for payment together.

distance from all other campers, we will be wearing masks at Wildwood Ranch. This is subject to change if the local case loads
dissipate and public mask wearing is no longer mandated or recommended.</p><p><button id="maskGuide" type="button" onclick="window.open('https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/covid-19/care/masks.aspx', '_blank')">King County Mask Mandate</button></p><p>All campers and staff wore masks in our summer sessions and we rarely had to remind campers to put them on. We are working hard to incorporate times each day when masks can be off and campers can still be having fun. Think noodle tag, parachute games, group games like mafia, and of course lunch and snacks.
</p><h2>Thank You</h2><p>We will continue to monitor the COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> situation and adapt as necessary. There may be a time at which we decide it is necessary to cancel sessions or close our
doors for the remainder of the season.</p><p>This is a very uncertain and unsettled time for us all. We thank you for supporting us through 2020 and continuing to trust us with your campers in 2021.</p><p>We wish you safety and happiness amidst the chaos.</p><p></p><p>Updated 3/11/2021</p></div></div></section></main></body><footer class="row justify-content-center"><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerLeft"><ul><li><a href="http://www.ultracamp.com/info/upcomingsessions.aspx?idCamp=1075&amp;campCode=WWR" target="_blank">Upcoming Sessions</a></li><li><a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Terms & Conditions</a></li></ul></section><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerMid"></section><section class="col-12 col-md-3" id="footerRight"><h3>Contact</h3><address><p>34920 SE Fall City Snoqualmie Rd <br/> Fall City, WA 98024</p><a id="emailLinkFooter" href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">info@wildwoodranch.co</a></address><section class="social"><a id="instaLinkFooter" href="https://www.instagram.com/wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-instagram"></i></a><a id="fbLinkFooter" href="https://www.facebook.com/wildwoodranch.co"><i class="fab fa-2x fa-facebook-square"></i></a><a id="emailLinkFooter2" href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co/"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-envelope-square"></i></a><a id="phoneLinkFooter" href="tel:4252605024"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-phone-square"></i><!--bump--></a></section></section></footer></html>
