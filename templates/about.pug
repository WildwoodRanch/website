                            Wildwood Ranch is the culmination of years of dreaming for sisters-in-law Kate and MacKenzie Kinsman.
                            Located on 20 gorgeous acres in Fall City, WA, Wildwood Ranch offers camps where kids ages 5 to 13 can
                            run wild and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Kids have the opportunity to learn how to ride and care for horses,
                            help in our camp garden and learn about where our food comes from, cook on a campfire, enjoy crafts, make
                            their own homestead snacks, play with all our farm animals, and have the freedom to just plain be themselves.

                        p.
                            As a wee child, MacKenzie attended a local summer camp, Shoofly Farm. As she grew her jobs on the farm kept growing with her!
                            After a decade of learning the ropes she began helping manage the camp. In her final years at Shoofly she served as 
                            interim-director a number of times. After graduating from Whitworth University, MacKenzie went on to become a biochemical
                             researcher. She quickly realized that her passion lay elsewhere. MacKenzie and her
                            husband Matthew have two beautiful young sons, and she now spends her days with the two little guys on the ranch.
