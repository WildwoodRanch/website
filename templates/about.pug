                        Wildwood Ranch is the culmination of years of dreaming for sister-in-laws Kate and MacKenzie Kinsman.
                        Located on 20 gorgeous acres in Fall City, WA, Wildwood Ranch offers camps where kids ages 5 to 13 can
                        run wild and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Kids have the opportunity to learn how to ride and care for horses,
                        help in our camp garden and learn about where our food comes from, cook on a campfire, enjoy crafts, make
                        their own homestead snacks, play with all our farm animals, and have the freedom to just plain be themselves.

                    p.
                        Kate grew up working at the local summer camp, Shoofly Farm. In no time at all she was managing the horse program there.
                        Kate graduated college and spent 2 summers as a mountaineering guide for teens and adults in British Columbia,
                        taking complete beginners on the adventure of a lifetime. As a guide, she realized that the outdoors has an
                        amazing capacity to teach us about ourselves. Kate went on to become a Web Developer and after a few years
                        in the tech industry realized that her passion was really in helping people to connect with the natural world.
                        While she's keeping her day job for now, Kate hopes to work with kids full-time soon.
                        She's eager to help children temper the messages of a fast-paced, image-conscious society with the messages
                        that nature has to share with us about imagination, compassion, and self-exploration.

                    p.
                        As a wee child, MacKenzie attended the local summer camp, Shoofly Farm. As she grew her jobs on the farm kept growing with her!
                        Eventually she began helping manage the camp. After college, MacKenzie went on to become a biochemical researcher. Like Kate,
                        she quickly realized that her passion was elsewhere. MacKenzie brought a bundle of joy into this world June 2018,
                        and now spends her days with the little man on the ranch.
