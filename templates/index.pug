                        Wildwood Ranch is located on 20 acres in Fall City, WA and offers camps where kids ages 5 to 13 can
                        run wild and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Kids will learn how to ride horses, cook on a
                        campfire, tend our garden, make crafts, and have the freedom to just plain be themselves. We believe 
                        in the power of disconnecting from technology and spending time outdoors to re-engage an individual's 
                        creative self. It is our goal to provide a grounding place in this fast world where campers and their 
                        families can slow down, take a breath, and be their true self while engaging in a community that is 
                        thoughtful and helps to grow connections.
