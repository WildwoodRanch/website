                        Wildwood Ranch is located on 20 acres in Fall City, WA and offers camps where kids ages 5 to 13 can
                        run wild and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Kids will learn how to ride horses, cook on a
                        campfire, tend our garden, make crafts, and have the freedom to just plain be themselves. We believe 
                        in the power of disconnecting from technology and spending time outdoors to re-engage an individual's 
                        creative self. It is our goal to provide a grounding place in this fast world where campers and their 
                        families can slow down, take a breath, and be their true self.

                        You may notice that our prices have increased about 10% since last summer, this is due to rising supply and labor costs. 
                        We are commited to providing a quality experience for our campers and at our outdoor camp that includes access to farm animals,
                        hay and feed prices have doubled in the past three years! In addition, we want our camp to be staffed with the best counselors
                        possible, so we are raising our pay rates this year above minimum wage for entry level staff and even higher for returners and
                        those with awesome skills! Thank you for supporting our programs and as always, please reach out to us if your family is in need
                        of scholarship funds.
