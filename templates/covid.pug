                            Alongside all of you, we have been following the COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> situation quite closely. We understand the dilemma that the school closures and the "stay at home" order poses to
                            working parents and have been pondering how best to help our community with child care in the current situation.

                            If your family is not comfortable participating in camp programs this year, we will be offering alternative family field trips to help get your family out of the house and break up the quarantine boredom!
                            Look for future announcements for details.

                            We have revised our refund policy for the year to allow for refunds to be given at any time, for any reason. We understand that finances at this time can be uncertain or strained. If your family has been
                            financially affected by COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>, please let us know and we can work out a plan for payment together.

                        p.
                            We understand that children have been home since the end of March and many families have had no childcare during this time. Kids need social interaction and time outdoor and while we are eager to meet
                            this need, we need to do so with safety measures in place.
                        p.
                            This summer we are limiting enrollment to 30 kids per week. We are further splitting each week into 3 groups of 10, moving each group through activities as independently as possible. We will be
                            eliminating “all camp” free time such as campfire time and large group games and moving them into our rotation of activities for groups to experience on their own to aid in social distancing.
                        p.
                            We will be performing fever checks each morning, any child with a temperature above 100°F will be asked to return home and will be refunded their camp tuition.
                        p.
                            As for sanitation policies, we are following the American Camp Association’s guide as closely as possible. We have two hand washing stations and will require everyone to wash hands upon arrival,
                            between activities, and before/after lunch and snacks (in addition to the usual washing after bathroom use and touching animals). Gates and doors will be sanitized every morning and evening, and
                            will be left open where possible so that campers are not touching them unless absolutely necessary.
                        p.
                            Craft supplies will be separated in advance and given to individual campers instead of having them communally available. Items that are shared (such as metal stamps for leather working) will be
                            sanitized between groups.                        p.

                            We will continue to monitor the COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> situation and adapt as necessary. There may be a time at which we decide it is necessary to cancel more weeks or close our
                            doors for the remainder of the season.
                        p This is a very uncertain and unsettled time for us all. We thank you for supporting us.
                        p We wish you safety and happiness amidst the chaos.
