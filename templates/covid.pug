                            As we look forward to this next summer, we are optimistic that there will be less restrictions due to 
                            lower local case loads and increased vaccinations in the general public. Whith that in mind, we will move 
                            forward cautiously and plan to limit registration so that campers may be placed in smaller groups that are kept
                            distanced from each other. At this time our requirement is that all staff and campers must wear face masks when
                            on Wildwood Ranch property, have temperatures taken upon arrival, and wash hands frequently or when prompted by 
                            counselors.

                        h2 Refund Policy
                        p.
                            We have revised our refund policy for the year to allow for refunds to be given at any time for COVID related circumstances. 
                            If your camper or anyone in your family tests positive for COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>,  believes they have 
                            COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> symptoms, or has been in close proximity of any confirmed cases without proper PPE, 
                            they must not attend camp and will receive a FULL refund for days missed. We understand that finances at this time can be 
                            uncertain or strained. If your family has been financially affected by COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span>, please let 
                            us know and we can work out a plan for payment together.
                        h2 How We Are Keeping Campers Safe
                        p.
                            We understand that children have been home since the end of March 2020 and many families have had no childcare during this time. 
                            Kids need social interaction and time outdoor and while we are eager to meet
                            this need, we need to do so with safety measures in place.
                        p.
                            This spring and summer we are limiting enrollment to 45 kids per week. We are further splitting each week into groups of 12 or less campers, 
                            moving each group through activities as independently as possible. We will be eliminating “all camp” free time such as campfire time and 
                            large group games and moving them into our rotation of activities for groups to experience on their own to aid in social distancing.
                        p.
                            We will be performing fever checks upon arrival, any child with a temperature above 100°F will be asked to return home and will be refunded their camp tuition.
                        p.
                            As for sanitation policies, we are following the American Camp Association’s guide as closely as possible. We have two hand washing stations and will require everyone to wash hands upon arrival,
                            between activities, and before/after lunch and snacks (in addition to the usual washing after bathroom use and touching animals). Gates and doors will be sanitized every morning and evening, and
                            will be left open where possible so that campers are not touching them unless absolutely necessary.

                        h2 Mask Policy
                        p.
                            Since most campers are above the minimum recommended mask-wearing age of 5 and will not be able to consistently keep a 6 ft distance from all other campers, we will be wearing masks at Wildwood Ranch. This is subject to change if the local case loads dissipate and public mask wearing is no longer mandated.

                        p.
                            All campers and staff wore masks in our summer sessions and we rarely had to remind campers to put them on. We are working hard to incorporate times each day when masks can be off and campers can still be having fun. Think noodle tag, parachute games, group games like mafia, and of course lunch and snacks.

                        p.
                            We will continue to monitor the COVID<span class="punctuation">-19</span> situation and adapt as necessary. There may be a time at which we decide it is necessary to cancel sessions or close our
                            doors for the remainder of the season.
                        p This is a very uncertain and unsettled time for us all. We thank you for supporting us through 2020 and continuing to trust us with your campers in 2021.
                        p We wish you safety and happiness amidst the chaos.
