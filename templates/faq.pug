                      p.
                            Our camps will start with a snack then move onto three activities for the afternoon which
                            could include campfire cooking, crafts, nature activities, outdoor group games, or animal
                            time. At this time we do not plan to ride horses during after school camps. Remember that t
                            he days are chillier and will be getting dark earlier, please dress your camper accordingly
                            with sweaters, long pants, coats, and appropriate footwear such as rain boots or sneakers that
                            don't mind getting muddy. Please pack a water bottle and a snack if your camper is a picky eater.

                      h3 What is your minimum attendance policy for fall after school camps<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                      p.
                            We need a minimum of 10 campers to run each day of camp. One week out we will send an email
                             alerting registrants if we have met this requirement. If we have less than 10 campers signed
                             up you are welcome to try and get friends to sign up to meet the requirement. If by 48hrs
                             before camp we do not have 10 campers we will be cancelling the day and issuing a full refund.
                              Thank you for understanding.

                        p.
                            Make sure to turn your blinker on and slow down a ways in advance of the turn off from Fall
                            City Snoqualmie Rd. The speed limit is 50 and there are many semis that drive down the road.
                            The driveway is between the white vinyl fenced fields and the row of mailboxes, just West of
                            the “All Pets go to Heaven” sign. Our driveway is shared with neighbors and is not quite
                            two lanes wide, please go slow and pass others safely and with care. Drive up along the
                            white fencing and turn right into the loop driveway with the enter sign. There are parking
                            spots at the top of the loop and continuing down the other side. Please park, then walk your
                            campers across the driveway and into the fields, there will be a check in table inside the
                            gate. Pick up in the same fashion, park then walk inside the gate to sign out your child for the day!

                      p.
                            Yes. When children are put into groups, they are asked to sit next to friends or family they wish to be
                            grouped with. Feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with special requests.

                        p.
                            Our average staff to camper ratio is 1:5.
                    div.question
                        h3 How do camper groups work<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Children are broken into groups of 8-12, depending on needs and requests. This is your child's home
                            base and how they are organized for activities. Each group has counselors which remain with the group
                            for the week. For camp in 2021, all sibling groups and carpools will be in the same group to aid in our effort
                            to cohort campers and limit exposure between groups. There is a question during registration asking about friends 
                            that may be attending the same week whom your camper wishes to be grouped with, if this changes feel free to email
                            <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with additional requests or concerns.

                        h3 Does my child have to pack a lunch<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Monday - Thursday children must bring sack lunches. Friday we have a cook-out,
                            so no sack lunch is needed. Snacks will be provided daily.
                    div.question
                        h3 Does my child have to eat breakfast before coming to camp<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Tuesday and Wednesday children have the opportunity to make breakfast sandwiches with egg, cinnamon-sugar,
                            or fruit filling. Monday, Thursday, and Friday children must eat before camp. Snacks will be provided.
                    div.question
                        h3 What happens if it is raining<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Camp still runs in the rain. We have several buildings that are under cover including the barn,
                            potting shed, and several spaces covered by awnings. We revise some activities to bring them under cover.
                            Bring some rain boots and a rain jacket, and possibly an extra change of clothes!
                    div.question
                        h3 How often will my child ride a horse and what if they do not want to<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Children have the opportunity to ride each day of camp. We have experience with reluctant
                            riders and will do our best to encourage them. We will not force any child to ride.
                    div.question
                        h3 My child knows how to ride a horse. Can they do something more advanced<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
                            make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
                            concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
                            Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.
