                      p.
                            Our camps will start with a snack then move onto three activities for the afternoon which
                            could include campfire cooking, crafts, nature activities, outdoor group games, or animal
                            time. At this time we do not plan to ride horses during after school camps. Remember that t
                            he days are chillier and will be getting dark earlier, please dress your camper accordingly
                            with sweaters, long pants, coats, and appropriate footwear such as rain boots or sneakers that
                            don't mind getting muddy. Please pack a water bottle and a snack if your camper is a picky eater.

                      h3 What is your minimum attendance policy for fall after school camps<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                      p.
                            We need a minimum of 10 campers to run each day of camp. One week out we will send an email
                             alerting registrants if we have met this requirement. If we have less than 10 campers signed
                             up you are welcome to try and get friends to sign up to meet the requirement. If by 48hrs
                             before camp we do not have 10 campers we will be cancelling the day and issuing a full refund.
                              Thank you for understanding.

                        p.
                            Yes, camp will run as usual on July 4th. We run 9am-3pm, if you have the day off from work use the morning to relax
                            before picking up your camper with plenty of time to get to your celebration before fireworks!
                    div.question
                        h3 What should my child bring to camp<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p Our farm is an active, outdoor-oriented camp so dressing appropriately is important. Be sure to pack an extra change of clothes and shoes for the week. Depending on the weather outlook for your child's week, don't forget:
                            ul
                                li Extra shoes - rain boots or sandals
                                li Extra pants, shorts or a bathing suit

                        p All children have the opportunity to work with and ride horses. For their safety they must bring:
                            ul
                                li a well fitting helmet (bicycle is okay)
                                li sturdy shoes capable of protecting their feet when working with animals, must be closed-toe
                        p We provide snacks and water daily, as well as a cookout lunch with lots of choices on Friday.
                            ul
                                li Pack a lunch Monday-Thursday.
                                li Daily drop off is 9:00am with pick up at 3:00pm. Check in on Mondays begins at 8:45.
                    div.question
                        h3 What does a typical day of camp look like<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Each day has 6 stations usually consisting of horseback riding, arts and crafts, cooking and
                            homestead snacks, group games, gardening, and animal time. The activities that occur in each
                            category change every day. For example, arts and crafts may make tie dye t-shirts, leather 
                            bracelets, puppets, picture frames, and friendship bracelets throughout the week. Garden time
                            may have a tasting tour, learning how plants grow, helping to tend the garden and plant new 
                            things, making chia pets, and planting their own sunflower. We have many activities and switch
                            them up throughout the summer so that the flow is familiar but no two days or weeks are ever identical. 
                    div.question
                        h3 How does Wildwood Ranch support diversity, equity and inclusion<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Thanks for asking! Our goal is to create an atmostphere where all people regardless of race, ethnicity,
                            social background, economic means, physical or mental abilities, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other factors
                            feel supported and safe. We feel strongly that camp is all about the community that you create and we are
                            striving to be an organization that will support all people who come to us. This might mean that some campers 
                            receive a bit more support than others, and that is good. This extends to both our campers and staff, and all staff
                            members are vetted to ensure that they have the same commitment to supporting all people.
                    div.question
                        h3 My camper needs more support due to ASD, ADD, ADHD, sensory processing disorder or another reason, can they still come to camp<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Please send us an email or call to talk with MacKenzie. We can support campers in many ways but are not accredited
                            in any specific way and do not employ a camp nurse or specialty support members. We can work with you to see
                            if we can tweak things to make camp successful for your camper by providing visual schedule supports,
                            timed reminders, quiet down locations and other adaptations. If your camper has a BCBA or other support person whom you 
                            would like to attend camp with them, we welcome that discussion and have experience making that work.
                    div.question
                        h3 Can I sign my camper up for multiple sessions in one year<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Short answer is yes. We change up our activities from day to day and week to week so that things are never
                            exactly the same. But that being said, some campers expect a totally new experience and are not happy 
                            returning. You know your camper best and should know whether or not coming multiple weeks is a good idea for them.

                        p.
                            Specialty camps are for campers ages 10-15 who are looking for a new experience at camp.
                            Half of each day will focus on their specialty projects while the other half will be spent experiencing the 
                            classic ranch activities such as horseback riding, gardening, crafts, homestead snacks, games, and small animal time. 
                            Campers will not do all 6 “classic” activities each day but will be able to experience all of them at 
                            least once during their week at camp. Limited to 10 campers per session.

                        h3 How is the Counselor in Training program different than your Classic Ranch Camp<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            The CIT program is for campers ages 12-15 who have attended Wildwood Ranch in
                            the past (not a strict requirement for 2023, but will be in the future) but are aging out of the program 
                            or are ready for a new 
                            adventure at camp. Each day will have dedicated time to learn, discuss, and practice leadership skills
                            as a team before exploring interests at camp and on the farm. CITs will have the opportunity to customize their week 
                            to their interests by helping in different areas. Possible placements at camp include working with the 
                            horses (learning ground skills, care and keeping, and body and tack parts), as a junior counselor to a
                            camper group, assisting in leading activities (arts and crafts, campfire cooking or games), helping
                            with the small animals, or working in our garden. Our goal is for each CIT to learn practical 
                            leadership skills, have a positive experience practicing and implementing those skills at camp, to have 
                            a deeper understanding of what it means to be a responsible citizen, and have fun!

                        p.
                            We can accommodate a wide variety of food allergies and medical needs. Please contact <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with any

                        p.
                            Camp starts at 9am and ends at 3pm. Drop off is 8:45-9:15. Pick up is 3-3:15, so no need to arrive before 3pm as
                            campers will not be released to the pick up area until 2:55, and when all parents attempt to arrive by 3pm
                            we run out of space for cars to wait.

                        h3 How do I reach the Ranch from the road and where should I park<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Make sure to turn your blinker on and slow down a ways in advance of the turn off from Fall
                            City Snoqualmie Rd. The speed limit is 50 and there are many semis that drive down the road.
                            The driveway is between the white vinyl fenced fields and the row of mailboxes. Our driveway is shared with neighbors and is not quite
                            two lanes wide, please go slow and pass others safely and with care. Drive up along the
                            white fencing and turn right into the loop driveway with the enter sign. There are parking
                            spots at the top of the loop and continuing down the other side. If you need additional time to get your
                            camper ready you may park and walk them to the pillars. Pick up and drop off for the week will occur in our 
                            loop driveway. Please stay in your car and pull forward to the pillars, we will bring all campers
                            up to the loop driveway at 3pm and check them out to you. Please update your authorized pickup lists
                            as we will not release campers to individuals not on it.

                            Children are split into groups of 8-12, depending on needs and requests. 
                            When children are put into groups on Monday mornings, they are asked to sit next to friends or family they wish to be
                            grouped with. Feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:info@wildwoodranch.co">us</a> with special requests 
                            if you feel your child will not be comfortable conveying this info to us. This group is your child's home
                            base and how they are organized for activities. Each group has counselors which remain with the group
                            for the week.

                        p.
                            Monday - Thursday children must bring a lunch. Friday we have a cook-out,
                            so no lunch is needed. Snacks will be provided daily.

                        p.
                            Camp still runs in the rain. We have several buildings that are under cover including the barn,
                            potting shed, and several spaces covered by awnings. We revise some activities to bring them under cover.
                            Bring some rain boots and a rain jacket, and possibly an extra change of clothes!
                    div.question
                        h3 How often will my child ride a horse and what if they do not want to<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            Children have the opportunity to ride each day of camp. We have experience with reluctant
                            riders and will do our best to encourage them. We will not force any child to ride.
                    div.question
                        h3 My child knows how to ride a horse. Can they do something more advanced<span class="punctuation">?</span>
                        p.
                            We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
                            make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
                            concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
                            Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.

                        p.
                            Please see our Cell Phone and Technology policy for full details, but in short, the less technology at camp, the better.
                            Campers and staff will not use phones at camp so that they are able to experience what it is to be fully
                            engaged in their current surroundings. If you need to get ahold of your camper for any reason feel free to call
                            or text us at 425-556-0500.
